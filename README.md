# google-books-app

# What is this?
- This an application that was converted to use apollo and graphql rather that traditional restful api routes
- With this app you can search and look for books using the google books api

# Installation
- To install and use this repository run npm i at the root of this file to install all the required dependencies
- Then run "npm run develop" to open this in the local host of your machine

# Usage 
- The login portion of the page is still being worked on as I do not have the time to finish it with work right now. I will continue to test and trouble shoot as I get the time
- To search for a book just type in the name of the book you are looking for and hit the search button and the book should appear, or the closest thing to it!

# Credits
- The Instructors at the UofM Coding Bootcamp for giving me all the tools necessary to complete this project
- The UofM Coding bootcamp for providing a majority of the starting code
- The awesome assistants at askBCS for helping me when I felt lost or stuck
